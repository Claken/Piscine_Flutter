# Diary App Part 2 : Manage data and display 

For the last module of the flutter piscine, I had to finish the diary app that I started with the previous module. <br/>

For the second part of the diary app project, I had to add some design for the profile page, along with an agenda page. 

## Profile Page

For this new profile page, new information has been added :
  - A profile image 
  - A logout button that logout the user and redirect him to the login page
  - A list of the last two entries
  - A list of the feeling and the percentage of use for all entries
  - A profile tab, and an agenda tab
