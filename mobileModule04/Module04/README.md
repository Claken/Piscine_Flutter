# Diary App Part 1 : Auth and DataBase

For the flutter piscine, I had to do a diary app where I can write entries, update them and delete them. <br/>
For the first part, I had to set up an authentication system to access the app, and a database to save the entries.

## Login Page

The login page os the first page which appears when you launch the page, with a simple login button : <br/>

When you click on it, the authentification system will be launched <br/>

<br/> (You need a Google account to log in)
<br/>

<br/>
Once you have logged in, you will be taken to your profile page.

## Profile Page

Here is an example of a profile page with two entries :

When you click on the "New Entry" button, this page will appear :
(When you done typing, tap on the check button in the top right-hand corner)

When you tap on an entry, an information note about the entry pops up :

If you choose to update the entry, you will come across this page :

![update](https://github.com/Claken/Piscine_Flutter/assets/51683861/88fbb155-663d-48ec-a299-516acf704434)

If you choose to delete the entry, you will come across this page :
