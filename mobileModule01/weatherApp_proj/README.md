# Weather App Project Part 1 : Structure and logic 

For this module, I had to conceive the structure and logic of my weather app application. <br/> <br/>
First, I created the bottom bar of my application with three tabs which have a name and a icon (“Currently”, “Today” and “Weekly”). <br/> 
When you switch tabs, the content of the page change to the name of the current tab. <br/>

Then, I created the app bar (the bar above) that includes a search Textfield, and a geolocation button. <br/>
When you click on the geolocation button, the text "Paris" is displayed in the middle of the app. <br/>
When you click on the search button, you can then write on the textfield a text which will be displayed in the middle of the app (and replace the existing text) : <br/>
