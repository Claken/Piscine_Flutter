For this module, I had to do some little exercices to learn the basics of the mobile application.

## ex00 ##
For this exercice, I had to code a simple button that triggers a debug message ("button pressed") when one clicks on it :

![simpleButton](https://github.com/Claken/Piscine_Flutter/assets/51683861/ab11dc24-59b4-409a-8806-69d19db7527b)

## ex01 ##
For this exercice, I had to modify the button I coded to switch to an other title when one clicks on it :

![buttonChangeTitle](https://github.com/Claken/Piscine_Flutter/assets/51683861/3c57faaf-3d5f-40c6-8d25-52625ef71e44)

## ex02 ##
For this exercice, I had to code a prototype of calculator that, when you press a button, only triggers a debug message telling which button was pressed :

![ex02calc](https://github.com/Claken/Piscine_Flutter/assets/51683861/7bc3f1fa-6ecc-4359-8fe4-cff5044c21a2)

## calculator_proj ##

For the last exercice, I took the same code as the previous one and made a real calculator :
