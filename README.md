# PISCINE FLUTTER
This project's goal is to learn the [Dart](https://dart.dev/) language and the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework through several exercices (a.k.a. modules) to be able to build mobile applications. <br />

This project is part of the 42 school post-common-core curriculum.

# What I gained from the project

With this project, I learn the basics of Dart and Flutter to build mobile applications : <br />
- I learned to use widgets to organize my code like Scaffold, ListView, TabBar, Container, etc.
- I learned to use [StatefulWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html) to handle states in a class
